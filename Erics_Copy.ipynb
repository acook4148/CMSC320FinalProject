    "Scraping Career Playoff Win Share total. The HTML table is easily parsed by pandas and only requires minimal cleaning. The Win Share Percentage is a metric which originated in Baseball but has been translated for basketball. It is a measure for how much an individual contributed to his teams success which in this case is playoff success. The metric cannot be calculated with the available data we have. The table only has the top 250 players which may seem unfair, but if a player is to be considered the best of all, I would hope they would be in the top 250 for post season success.  You can read more about it and how it is calculated here:<br>\n",

    "The data we used is from basketball-reference.com as seen before. The data is the totals for each season. Unfortunately there were no easily accessible databases with player career totals so we have to do this ourselves. To do this we merge one seasons data with the next using an outer join on player name. This means that if a player appears in both season data, their data row now has the data from both seasons. Additionally because of the outer join, a player that is only in one of the seasons is also kept in the table. To calculate the total we sum the two seasons data which is differentiated as PTS_x and PTS_y, then to keep the table from getting to messy we remove those unneeded season totals. The result is every possible players total stats between the two seasons. The first season's merge is shown here"

    "This rating is for scoring efficiency. Missing a shot in basketball is usually rebounded by the other team(could show stats) and can almost be thought of as a turnover. This is why shots from the field (career_3P and career 2P) are only considered in relation to the respective shooting percentage. This has the added effect of emphasizing the \"Big\" positions known as Center or guards as they often shoot close to the basket for high percentage shots."

    "Best 3 Point Shooter<br><br>\n",
    "While we did our best to emphasize different parts of the game, we felt that 3 point shooting was important enough to deserve its own analysis and award. The best 3 Point shooter is one who shoots many 3 pointers but also with a high completage rate. While this may seem similar to offensive rating 2, 3 pointers by the nature are lower percentage shots. The scatter plot below shows the normal percentage being <40% whereas shooters in the paint are much higher(Shaquille's O'Neal's shooting percentage). Therefore 3 point shooters were not overshadowed by the dominant centers of the league. This analysis is much simpler and solely focused on shoting percentage and career 3 pointers made. To be considered great you must have both, making a lot of 3 pointers off of many shots means equally little as making one 3 pointer on one attempt every game. "

    "It is no secret that the NBA is an offensive game. The freqent scoring and high point totals prove that beyond a doubt. As such defense rating is a much simpler calculation. Recently there have been more technical defensive ratings but as they are not implemented for older seasons we thought it best to base our rating on the classic defensive stats: blocks, steals, and rebounds. Blocks and steals are weighted more heavily as they often lead to a fast break and mean more in a game. Generally defensive rebounds are higher and often mean that the opposing team just missed their shot. However they are still an important stat and showcase the ability of a player to be in the right place for a rebound, fighting out the offensive players for the ball. "
